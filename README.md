## Overview
This project demonstrates a robotic arm controlled using computer vision for real-time color-based object sorting. OpenCV is used for color detection, and an ESP32 microcontroller controls servo motors based on detected colors.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- ESP32
- Servo Motors
- Serial Communication

## Applications
- Automated sorting systems
- Robotics and automation learning
- Computer vision based control systems
